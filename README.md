# DALI Collaborative Coding and Design

Today you'll be learning a bunch of things to help prep you for your 17W term in DALI!  You'll try your hand at some design and some web coding as well as the ins and outs of an essential concept used in software design and development — version control. We'll be using git and github (the site you're at now!) to learn how manage multiple people working on the same document at the same time — all while having the ability to backup and revert your work. If this is all new to you, don't worry! We'll start from the beginning and build from there.

## Overview

*  Each person will use git to clone this repository.  
*  Then you'll edit some basic html to add a page about yourself to the site.
*  You can either practice html/css/js for your page or design it in Sketch.
*  Then you'll commit and merge your changes of the page and push your changes to the git repo.

This mostly assumes that you are using a recent version of OS X, so your mileage may vary.
