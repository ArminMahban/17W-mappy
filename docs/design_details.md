# Design Task

## Purpose
To gain familiarity with Sketch, a powerful UI/UX design application, and to get your design chops warmed up before the beginning of the term!

## Before you begin
1. Download a free trial of Sketch from: https://sketchapp.com.  
2. Watch the short Sketch tutorials on *Introducing Symbols*, *Symbol Resizing*, and *Using Masks*: https://sketchapp.com/learn/.

## Page Requirements

### Your page should include 2 sections:
1. Your bio
2. A style guide

### For Your Bio:

The design of your bio should include:

* A picture
* Your name
* Where you’re from/where you live
* A short bio telling us about yourself (you might include/mention: design applications you know, what you enjoy most about ui/ux design, why you’re excited to work with DALI)
* And something interesting about yourself :-)

* Create a complex symbol to use in your design, duplicate the symbol, and use the override option to change information in your symbol.

* Create a mask to crop some content on your page.

### For Your Style Guide:

Your style guide should include:

1. A short description/rationale explaining your design choices
2. Type styles — include the name of the typeface, sizes, styles, and colors used
