# Design Onboarding

## Purpose
To gain familiarity with Sketch, a powerful UI/UX design application, and to get your design chops warmed up before the beginning of the term!

## Instructions
If you're a designer and you've never worked with Sketch before, please follow the directions for the design task. If you’re comfortable with Sketch, feel free to follow the dev section and use html and css to create your page.

# Design Task

## Before you begin
Watch the short Sketch tutorials on Introducing Symbols, Symbol Resizing, and Using Masks https://sketchapp.com/learn/.

## What you'll make
Use Sketch to design a web page telling us about yourself. Be creative! Your design should tell us something about your personality, so consider this when you make design choices about type, color, and decisions about your layout. 

You can download a free trial of Sketch from: https://sketchapp.com. 

### Your page will have two sections:
1. Your bio
2. A style guide

### Information to include in the design of your bio:
* A picture
* Your name
* Where you’re from/where you live
* A short bio telling us about yourself (you might include/mention: design applications you know, what you enjoy most about ui/ux design, why you’re excited to work with DALI)
And something interesting about yourself :-)

* Create a complex symbol to use in your design, duplicate the symbol, and use the override option to change information in your symbol.

* Create a mask to crop some content on your page.
