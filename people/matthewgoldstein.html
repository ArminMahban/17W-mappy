      <ul>
        <li>My name is Matthew Goldstein.</li>
        <li>I'm a sophomore at Dartmouth College, majoring in Philosophy
          and Computer Science, but I spend most of my time drawing cartoons
          that my parents and some of my friends find funny.</li>
        <li>I enjoy when the first and last words of a novel form a
          coherent phrase.</li>
        <li>My dislikes include social climbing, green olives, TV commercials
          for awnings, genocide, and zippers that get stuck frequently.</li>
        <li>I have worked at MSNBC, with a health juice company, for a hedge
          fund, and in a beach club food court.</li>
        <li>Contrary to popular belief, I have only ten toes.</li>
        <li>I once took a philosophy class in which I began to question my
          own existence, but then I got a paper cut and I realized I was,
          unfortunately, still there.</li>
        <li>I have never had a P.O. box.</li>
